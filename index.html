<h1>Eat Healthy for Less</h1>
<p>Eat Healthy for Less is a meal planning app (coming soon!) that will
help you save money on groceries while achieving your nutrition goals.</p>

<h3>What can Eat Healthy for Less do for me?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spending too much money on groceries?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worried about you and your kids eating right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having trouble following your doctor's diet advice?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Eat Healthy for Less will ask you a few questions about your goals and
then zip you straight to a week's worth of dinner recipes and a shopping
list with the groceries you need to make them. Ready to shop in 60
seconds!</p>
<h3>Prototype demo</h3>
<p>This video shows the app prototype we demoed at Google Hack for Change
just 48 hours after our team got together. The concept of the app shines
through, even though it was a rush job and there were some problems with
our food price database.</p>

<h3>Why this app is so important</h3>
<p>Here's the presentation that accompanied our demo. We think our app
could have a big impact on a lot of people who <em>want</em> to eat healthy but
aren't sure where to start. So many times, the reaction when we tell a
friend about the app is that they want to use it right away.</p>
