# Eat Healthy for Less

Eat Healthy for Less is a meal planning app (coming soon!) that will
help you save money on groceries while achieving your nutrition goals.

### What can Eat Healthy for Less do for me?

 * Spending too much money on groceries?

 * Worried about you and your kids eating right?

 * Having trouble following your doctor's diet advice?

Eat Healthy for Less will ask you a few questions about your goals and
then zip you straight to a week's worth of dinner recipes and a shopping
list with the groceries you need to make them. Ready to shop in 60
seconds!

### Prototype demo

This video shows the app prototype we demoed at Google Hack for Change
just 48 hours after our team got together. The concept of the app shines
through, even though it was a rush job and there were some problems with
our food price database.

### Why this app is so important

Here's the presentation that accompanied our demo. We think our app
could have a big impact on a lot of people who *want* to eat healthy but
aren't sure where to start. So many times, the reaction when we tell a
friend about the app is that they want to use it right away.

### About us

![Google Hack for Change Winners](award.jpg)

The Eat Healthy for Less project was just a crazy idea on the morning of
Saturday June 1, but a pickup team of developers at the Google Hack for
Change 2013 hackathon turned it into a winning app in just 48 hours!

Meet the team:

 * Trey Smith. Systems Scientist, Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
   Valley / NASA Ames. Project lead and Django-naut. "Eat Healthy for
   Less really just turns what my Mom taught me about grocery shopping
   into an app to help others learn the same techniques."

 * Jason Mow. Student at University of Pennsylvania, Android intern at Upthere. Front end, integration, and demo lead. Will never buy too much or too little at the grocery store again.

 * Sid Askary. Coder, data wrangler, and outreach.

 * Ganesh Sarwate. Coder and data wrangler. Ganesh wasn't satisfied
   with winning the hackathon and went straight into coding up a
   native Android app on Sunday night!

 * Kenneth Ng. Coder and mobile web guy.

 * Joseph Victor. Currently attending Stanford University for a MS in
   Data Science.  Coder and enthusiest for math, programming and healthy
   nammy vegegarian food.
