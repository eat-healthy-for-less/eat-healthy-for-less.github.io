### What can Eat Healthy for Less do for me?

 * Spending too much money on groceries?

 * Worried about you and your kids eating right?

 * Having trouble following your doctor's diet advice?

Eat Healthy for Less will ask you a few questions about your goals and
then zip you straight to a week's worth of dinner recipes and a shopping
list with the groceries you need to make them. Ready to shop in 60
seconds!

### About Us

![The Eating Healthy for Less hackathon team](team_photo_600.jpg)

The Eat Healthy for Less project was just a crazy idea on the morning of
Saturday June 1, but a pickup team of developers at the Google Hack for
Change 2013 hackathon turned it into a winning app in just 48 hours!

Meet the team:

 * Trey Smith. Systems Scientist, Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
   Valley / NASA Ames. Project lead and Django-naut. "Eat Healthy for
   Less really just turns what my Mom taught me about grocery shopping
   into an app to help others learn the same techniques."

 * Jason Mow. Student at University of Pennsylvania. Front end,
   integration, and demo lead.

 * Sid Askary. Coder, data wrangler, and outreach.

 * Ganesh Sarwate. Coder and data wrangler. Ganesh wasn't satisfied
   with winning the hackathon and went straight into coding up a
   native Android app on Sunday night!

 * Kenneth Ng. Coder and mobile web guy.

 * Joseph Victor. Currently attending Stanford University for a MS in Data Science.  
   Coder and enthusiest for math, programming and healthy nammy vegegarian food.    

 * Samer Buna. Coder and data wrangler.

 * Nandita Garud. Genetics PhD student at Stanford
   University. Statistician and design thinker.

We'd like to thank the Google Hack for Change organizers for putting on
a great event!
